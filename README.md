# Lunar Lander project: The Lunar Lander-v2 problem consists of an 8- dimensional continuous state space and a discrete action space. There are four discrete actions available: do noth- ing, fire the left orientation engine, fire the main engine, fire the right orientation engine. The landing pad is al- ways at coordinates (0,0). Coordinates consist of the first two numbers in the state vector. The total reward for moving from the top of the screen to landing pad ranges from 100 - 140 points varying on lander placement on the pad. If the lander moves away from the landing pad it is penalized the amount of reward that would be gained by moving towards the pad. An episode finishes if the lander crashes or comes to rest, receiving additional -100 or +100 points respectively. Each leg ground contact is worth +10 points. Firing the main engine incurs a -0.3 point penalty for each occurrence. Landing outside of the landing pad is possible. Fuel is infinite, so, an agent could learn to fly and then land on its first attempt. The prob- lem is considered solved when achieving a score of 200 points or higher on average over 100 consecutive runs.

EXECUTION: run LL.py in your local machine, with the necessary packages listed in the top of the code installed. It takes quite a long time to run the program (about 4 hours in my machine). You will obtain 5 figures once it is done.
